          is a city on the Ganges river in northern India that has a central place in pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world. The name Varanasi was officially so revived after 1947, but the city is still widely known as Banaras or Benares (Banāras; [bəˈnaːrəs] (audio speaker iconlisten)), and since ancient times also as Kashi. The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its tourism. Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's capital New Delhi, 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state capital, Lucknow, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) east of Allahabad, another Hindu pilgrimage site.</p>
          <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The old fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire. The current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burned down and the current structure is also known as the new fort.</p>
          <p>Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities.[18] Kashi, its ancient name, was associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have given his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath in 528 BCE. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.</p>

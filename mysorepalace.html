        also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and the royal
        residence (house) at Mysore in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is used
        to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the
        Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the
        Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of
        Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however,
        'Mysore Palace' or 'Amba Vilas Palace' refers specifically to the one
        within the Old fort.</p>
        <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The old fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire. The current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burned down and the current structure is also known as the new fort.</p>
        <p>Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors.</p>

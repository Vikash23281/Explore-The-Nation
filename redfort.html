    <h3>
      <p>
        The<span style="color: red"> <font size="8">Red Fort</font></span> or
        Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as
        the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan
        commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he
        decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and
        white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
        constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal
        architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace
        architecture with Indian traditions. The fort was plundered of its
        artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in
        1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished
        by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's
        defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was
        subsequently used as a garrison.

        On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru,
        raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's
        Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian
        tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally
        broadcast speech from its ramparts.

        The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part
        of the Red Fort Complex.
